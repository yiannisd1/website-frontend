            "description":"The project has the goal of creating a fun, beautiful single player game that users can play with their exercise bike. It’s a post-apocalyptic tribal world where players deliver packages between nomadic tribes on a junked-up pod-bicycle. The overall goal is to have a wide environment to ride around in with various missions available. Completing the missions will be a test of speed/endurance but may also include interesting gameplay choices relating to things such as fragile or perishable packages. By introducing fun gameplay mechanics and a beautiful landscape into their exercise routine, players will have more motivation to exercise on a regular basis."

            "description":"This project has the goal of encouraging people to get outside and exercise, and to explore the local area and perhaps take routes they haven’t gone down before. To achieve this, the app will, before leaving the house to exercise, give a user a randomly selected image or drawing, the goal of the run or bike ride is then to as closely as possible match the drawing on a map that tracks the users’ movements through streets and paths. At the end of the run or bike ride the user will get a score based on how closely they followed the prompt. The goal of this project is to have a working version, either a prototype or initial release, by the end of this trimester, that can then be expanded and improved upon in the future into a fully-fledged app available to the public."

            "description":"Building an interactive, learning and fitness VR camping experience provides our Redback Operation with an evolving platform that users can enjoy exercise and learn together within our design application. Camp Exercise Simulator is a single-player sports camping game. We will create one or more relatively real wild worlds in the game. Different worlds have different season styles. Each game world can be divided into multiple areas. Each area has different landform features, and players can perform some interactions and field sports according to different landform features. The main purpose of the project is to improve people's physical health so that players can understand and learn the skills and knowledge of camping in the wild. It includes playable and interactive sports elements, such as fishing, climbing, chopping firewood, and making a fire. VR devices and real-world future exercising equipment/technologies will be used as the basic equipment for the project. These interactive elements of movement will be combined with sensors so that players can feel the feeling of camping in the game, and finally achieve the purpose of exercising."

The Data Science & Analysis team aims to identify, develop, and maintain a sophisticated data storage solution that is commensurate with the data that will be produced from our IoT sensor division and our game development division. By developing a sophisticated open-source data storage solution, we can potentially eliminate problems of scalability, security and uptime of our other projects that may be encountered in the future. This will include consultation with members of our IoT, DevOps and Game development teams in order to make seamless the ability to store data on the web site and how to implement data transfer from IoT into database storage "

To this end the team will seek to produce a number of analyses based on market trends in both the gaming space and the IoT sensor space. This should provide Redback Operations with both short and long-term solutions to the marketability of their products, and whether products they are currently working on are viable. "

For example, standard pushups should begin with chest and stomach flat to the floor and should remain in a straight line while pushing up and coming back down. Not following the correct posture, could lead to injuries and not provide the desired result. This goes for all exercises. The main objective of the project is to develop an IoT System consisting of a variety of devices including sensors to detect posture, smart watches to detect fall and measure heartbeat rate, blood oxygen level.
